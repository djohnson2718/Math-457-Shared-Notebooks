From this page, click on the name of a notebook to view a read-only copy of it.

If you want your own copy to modify and play with (highly encouraged), after clicking on it as above, right click on the "Raw" button and choose "Save target as..." or your browsers equivalent. Save it, and then upload it using the "Upload" button on your own Jupyter Sage server.
